                <p>I'm a front-end developer who has recently relocated to Toronto, ON.</p>
                <p>I have 4 yearsâ€™ experience working in front-end development including technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ember.js, Bootstrap, and node.js. I work on both Lunux/Unix and PC environments and Iâ€™m proficient with CLI and git.</p>
                <p>Most of my experience is with Ember.js framework, but recently I began my journey with React.js library. So far, I love it! <span role="img" aria-label="rock and roll hand">ðŸ¤Ÿ</span> I'm very enthusiastic about JavaScript, MongoDB, node.js, and I'm looking forward to continuing my career as a front-end developer.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my website. Please feel free to contact me.</p>
