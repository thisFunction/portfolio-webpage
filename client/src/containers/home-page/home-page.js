                <p>My name is Adam and I am a front-end developer. I write web applications in Ember.js and React. I have over four years of experience working on client facing apps. The projects I have worked on include conference registration forms, e-commerce websites, a robo-advisor app, and a SaaS tool for managers. I speak HTML, CSS, JS, RWD, and currently improving my WCAG.</p>
                <p>When I am not coding, I enjoy making pour-over coffee, listening to vinyl records, and reading American postmodern fiction. I am also an avid biker.</p>
