                <p>I'm a front-end developer who has recently relocated to Toronto, ON.</p>
                <p>I have about 4 years’ experience working in front-end development including technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (including ES6), Ember.js, Bootstrap 3 and node.js. I work on both Mac and PC environments and I’m proficient with CLI and git.</p>
                <p>Most of my experience is with Ember.js framework, but recently I began my journey with React.js library. So far, I love it! I'm very enthusiastic about JavaScript, MongoDB, node.js, and I'm looking forward to continuing my career here in Canada.</p>
