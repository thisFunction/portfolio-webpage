        <p>I'm a front-end developer who has recently relocated to Toronto, ON from Kraków, Poland. 
        I have about 4 years’ experience in front-end development and worked with technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (including ES6), Ember.js, Bootstrap 3 and node.js. 
        I worked on both Mac and PC environments and I’m proficient with CLI and git.</p>
        <p>While most of my experiance is with the Ember.js framework, I have recently began my journey into React.js, and so far, I love it! I'm very enthusuatic about JavaScript</p>
