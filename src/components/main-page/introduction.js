        <span class="separate-line">Hello!</span>
        <p>I'm a front-end developer who has recently relocated to Toronto, ON. 
        I have about 4 years’ experience in front-end development and worked with technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (including ES6), Ember.js, Bootstrap 3 and node.js. 
        I worked on both Mac and PC environments and I’m proficient with CLI and git.</p>
        <p>While most of my experience is with the Ember.js framework, I have recently began my journey with React.js, and so far, I love it! I'm very enthusiastic about JavaScript and I'm looking forward to continuing my career in Canada.</p>
