# Adam Skoczylas - Website

This is my full-stack MERN personal/portfolio website.

It is deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) and can be seen by visiting https://adam-skoczylas.herokuapp.com/.

## To-do:

    - Work on goals app
    - Connect goals app to MongoDB
    - Add smoothie delight site
    - Add sticky notes app
    - Add about me page
- Write tests
- Add scroll state on home page
    - intro section stays scrolled down after changing routes

## Nice to haves:
